--- @class uiShowRestMenuEventData
--- @field block boolean If set to `true`, vanilla logic will be suppressed. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field claim boolean If set to `true`, any lower-priority event callbacks will be skipped. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field allowRest boolean true if the player is allowed to sleep (determined primarily from the cell flags), or false if they must wait instead. This value can be modified.
--- @field scripted boolean *Read-only*. This value is true when the menu is shown from using the ShowRestMenu or equivalent function.
