--- @meta

--- The typical base type for most NetImmerse scene graph objects.
--- @class niAVObject : niObjectNET, niObject
--- @field alphaProperty niAlphaProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's alpha property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid alpha property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field appCulled boolean A flag indicating if this object is culled. When culled, it will not render, and raycasts ignore it.
--- @field flags number Flags, dependent on the specific object type.
--- @field fogProperty niFogProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's fog property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid fog property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field materialProperty niMaterialProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's material property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid material property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field parent niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSwitchNode The object's parent. It may not have one if it is not attached to the scene.
--- @field properties niPropertyLinkedList The list of properties attached to this niAVObject.
--- @field rotation tes3matrix33 The object's local rotation matrix.
--- @field scale number The object's local uniform scaling factor.
--- @field stencilProperty niStencilProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's stencil property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid stencil property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field texturingProperty niTexturingProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's texturing property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid texturing property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field translation tes3vector3 The object's local translation vector.
--- @field vertexColorProperty niVertexColorProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's vertex coloring property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid vertex coloring property will set (or replace) it.
--- @field zBufferProperty niZBufferProperty|nil Convenient access to this object's z-buffer property. Setting this value to be nil will erase the property, while setting it to a valid z-buffer property will set (or replace) it.
