--- Loads the given module. This functions identically to `require`, but will return `nil` instead of erroring if the module couldn't be found. If there is another error is found inside the included file, it will still cause an error in the `include`ing file.
--- 
--- The function starts by looking into the `package.loaded` table to determine whether `modname` is already loaded. If it is, then `include` returns the value stored at `package.loaded[modname]`. Otherwise, it tries to find a loader for the module.
--- 
--- Intended use case for this function is for making interoperability between mods.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/include).
--- @param modname string No description yet available.
--- @return table|nil result No description yet available.
