# Operator Definitions Guide

Operator overloads are documented similarly to the methods of their parent class. The operator oveload definition file is just a regular Lua table. The name of the needs to be the same as the Lua [operator metamethod](http://lua-users.org/wiki/MetatableEvents) name without the two leading underscores. The supported operators are:
- unm - unary minus
- add - addition
- sub - subtraction
- mul - multiplication
- div - division
- idiv - floor division (division with rounding down to nearest integer), the `//` operator.
- mod - the `%` operator
- pow - the `^` operator
- concat - the `..` operator.
- len - the `#` operator

The format of operator definition is:

| Field       | Type      | Description |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
|  type       | `string`  | The type of the definition. This flag is used when generating syntax highlighting files. This should always be `"operator"` for operator overload defintions. |
| overloads   | `table`   | The table with the oveloads. |


The format of the `overloads` table:

| Field       | Type     | Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rightType   | `string` | *Optional.* The right operand type. Don't specify this for the unary operators. |
| resultType  | `string` | The resulting type of the expression.                                           |
| description | `string` | The description of the operation.                                               |

An example of a typical operator definition:

```Lua
-- autocomplete\definitions\namedTypes\tes3matrix33\mul.lua
return {
	type = "operator", -- Necessary for operator definitions
	overloads = {
		{ rightType = "tes3matrix33", resultType = "tes3matrix33", description = "The matrix multiplication. Geometrically, this will concatenate the transformations of both matrices in the resulting matrix." },
		{ rightType = "tes3vector3", resultType = "tes3vector3", description = "Multiplies the matrix by a vector. The resulting vector is staring vector with the matrix' transformations applied." },
		{ rightType = "number", resultType = "tes3matrix33", description = "Multiplies the matrix by a scalar." },
	}
}
```

Here is an example of the unary length (`#`) operator definition:

```Lua
-- autocomplete\definitions\namedTypes\tes3vector3\len.lua
return {
	type = "operator",
	overloads = {
		{ resultType = "number", description = "Evaluates to the vector's length in [game units](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/other/game-units/)." },
	}
}
```

## Why

Adding these definitions helps mod developers, because with these definitions VSCode can give proper type suggestions.
