# attackHit

This event is invoked whenever an actor makes an attack with their fists or a weapon, or a creature makes any attack. It occurs at the moment a melee attack would hit, at the end of a melee weapon strike. For projectile attacks, it is when an arrow is about to detach from its bow. A target is not required to be present for this event.

Lockpicks and probes do not invoke this event.

```lua
--- @param e attackHitEventData
local function attackHitCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.attackHit, attackHitCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`reference`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor making the attack.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. A shortcut to the reference that is attacking.
* `targetMobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor being attacked. May be nil, e.g. if nothing was targeted.
* `targetReference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. A shortcut to the reference being attacked. May be nil, e.g. if nothing was targeted.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Convert Hits to Misses"

	```lua
	local function onAttackHitCallback(e)
		-- Set damage to zero to convert the physical hit to a miss.
		tes3.messageBox("Somehow it missed!")
		e.mobile.actionData.physicalDamage = 0
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.attackHit, onAttackHitCallback)

	```
