# damaged

The damaged event triggers after an actor has been damaged.

```lua
--- @param e damagedEventData
local function damagedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.damaged, damagedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `activeMagicEffect` ([tes3magicEffect](../../types/tes3magicEffect)): *Read-only*. Magic effect which caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `attacker` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor dealing the damage. Can be `nil`.
* `attackerReference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The attacker mobile's associated reference. Can be `nil`.
* `damage` (number): *Read-only*. The amount of damage done.
* `killingBlow` (boolean): *Read-only*. If true, the damage killed the target.
* `magicEffectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](../../types/tes3magicEffectInstance)): An instance of the magic effect in the spell that caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `magicSourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](../../types/tes3magicSourceInstance)): A `tes3magicSourceInstance` object of a spell that caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor that took damage.
* `projectile` ([tes3mobileProjectile](../../types/tes3mobileProjectile)): *Read-only*. Projectile that dealt the damage. Can be `nil`.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The mobile’s associated reference.
* `source` (string): *Read-only*. The origin of damage. These damage sources are present as [`tes3.damageSource`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/damage-sources/) constants. See the example. Damage with `tes3.damageSource.shield` source comes from magic shields. Other sources are self-explanatory.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Notify the player that their arrow/bolt killed their opponent"

	```lua
	
	-- Print a message if player's arrow killed its target
	local function onDamaged(e)
		-- We only care if the player did the damage
		if e.attackerReference ~= tes3.player then
			return
		end
	
		-- Check if the damage was caused by a projectile, but not by a spell, so it must be an arrow or a bolt
		if e.projectile ~= nil and e.magicSourceInstance == nil then
	
			-- Did the damage kill the target?
			if e.killingBlow == true then
				tes3.messageBox("Your arrow felled its target!")
			end
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.damaged, onDamaged)

	```

!!! example "Example: Detect that the player died from drowning"

	```lua
	local function onDamaged(e)
		-- We only care if the player recieved the damage
		if e.reference ~= tes3.player then
			return
		end
	
		-- Does the damage come from drowining?
		if e.source ~= tes3.damageSource.suffocation then
			return
		end
	
		-- Is the player in Mudan Grotto?
		if tes3.mobilePlayer.cell.id:lower() == "mudan grotto" then
	
			-- Did the damage kill the player?
			if e.killingBlow == true then
				tes3.messageBox("You died diving for treasure!")
			end
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.damaged, onDamaged)
