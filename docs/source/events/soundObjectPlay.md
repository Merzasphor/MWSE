# soundObjectPlay

This event triggers before certain object sounds are about to be played. For example, item pickup sounds.

```lua
--- @param e soundObjectPlayEventData
local function soundObjectPlayCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.soundObjectPlay, soundObjectPlayCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`sound`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `flags` (number): A flag whether the sound is looping or not. 0 means the sound doesn't loop, 1 means the sound loops.
* `isNot3D` (boolean): 
* `pitch` (number): The pitch-shift multiplier. For 22kHz audio (most typical) it can have the range [0.005, 4.5]; for 44kHz audio it can have the range [0.0025, 2.25].
* `sound` ([tes3sound](../../types/tes3sound)): The sound about to be played.
* `volume` (number): The volume of the sound. In range [1, 250].
