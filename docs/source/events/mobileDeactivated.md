# mobileDeactivated

This event is called when a mobile object is deactivated. This includes NPCs, creatures and projectiles, but not the player. Typically this happens when an actor dies, a creature gets unsummoned, a projectile collides with something or expires or when the player transitions from one cell to another, causing actors in previously visited cells to get deactivated.

```lua
--- @param e mobileDeactivatedEventData
local function mobileDeactivatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.mobileDeactivated, mobileDeactivatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `mobile` ([tes3mobileObject](../../types/tes3mobileObject)): *Read-only*. The deactivated mobile object.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The reference that the mobile object has been deactivated for.
