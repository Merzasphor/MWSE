# bodyPartsUpdated

This event is triggered when an actor's body parts have finished updating. This typically triggers when an actor is first rendered, or when their equipment changes.

```lua
--- @param e bodyPartsUpdatedEventData
local function bodyPartsUpdatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.bodyPartsUpdated, bodyPartsUpdatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor whose body parts were updated.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The reference for the actor whose body parts were updated.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: In this example all the scene graph nodes that make up left arm are culled. That will effectively make all the left arms in the game disappear."

	```lua
	local leftArmParts = {
		tes3.activeBodyPart.leftForearm,
		tes3.activeBodyPart.leftHand,
		tes3.activeBodyPart.leftUpperArm,
		tes3.activeBodyPart.leftWrist,
		tes3.activeBodyPart.shield
	}
	
	---@param e bodyPartsUpdatedEventData
	local function ripLefties(e)
		local bpm = e.reference.bodyPartManager
		if (not bpm) then return end
	
		-- Hide all left arm nodes.
		for _, part in ipairs(leftArmParts) do
	
			-- We want to hide the body parts in all the three
			-- layers that make up the character's body.
			for _, layer in pairs(tes3.activeBodyPartLayer) do
				local activePart = bpm:getActiveBodyPart(layer, part)
				if (activePart and activePart.node) then
					activePart.node.appCulled = true
				end
			end
		end
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.bodyPartsUpdated, ripLefties)

	```
