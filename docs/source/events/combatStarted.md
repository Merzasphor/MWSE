# combatStarted

The **combatStarted** event occurs after combat has began between two actors. This event is preceded by the [combatStart](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/combatStart) event.

```lua
--- @param e combatStartedEventData
local function combatStartedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.combatStarted, combatStartedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
