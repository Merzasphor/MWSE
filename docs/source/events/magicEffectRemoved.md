# magicEffectRemoved

This event triggers when a magic effect has been removed from an actor. This includes magic effects that have been resisted or are part of abilities like racial passives and diseases.

```lua
--- @param e magicEffectRemovedEventData
local function magicEffectRemovedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.magicEffectRemoved, magicEffectRemovedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`reference`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
