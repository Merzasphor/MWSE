# uiEvent

uiEvent is triggered through various UI events. This includes scrolling through panes, clicking buttons, selecting icons, or a host of other UI-related activities.

```lua
--- @param e uiEventEventData
local function uiEventCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.uiEvent, uiEventCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`source.id`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
