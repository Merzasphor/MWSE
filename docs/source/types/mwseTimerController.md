# mwseTimerController

A Timer Controller is a class used to sort and trigger callbacks based on an arbitrary timekeeping mechanic. By default there are three Timer Controllers for each type of timers: `timer.simulate`, `timer.game` or `timer.real`.

## Properties

### `clock`

The current clock time for this timer controller. Timer Controller, responsible for `timer.game` type of timers, has clock equal to the game's simuation timestamp. Timer Controllers, responsible for `timer.real`, and `timer.simulate`, types of timers have their initial clock set to `0` on a new game, and their clock's progressions is equal to `deltaTime`. Timer Controller's, responsible for `timer.simulate` timers, clock only advances when the menu mode is off.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

## Methods

### `create`

Creates a timer for the given Timer Controller.

```lua
local timer = myObject:create({ duration = ..., callback = ..., iterations = ..., persists = ..., data = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `duration` (number)
	* `callback` (function, string)
	* `iterations` (integer): *Default*: `1`.
	* `persists` (boolean): *Default*: `true`.
	* `data` (table, nil): *Default*: `nil`.

**Returns**:

* `timer` ([mwseTimer](../../types/mwseTimer))

***

## Functions

### `new`

Creates a new Timer Controller. Its initial clock is zero, unless a start time is provided.

```lua
local result = mwseTimerController.new(startTime)
```

**Parameters**:

* `startTime` (number): *Optional*.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([mwseTimerController](../../types/mwseTimerController))
