Setting this to lower values than the default increases the impact on performance. The default value for a newly created actor depends on the total amount of all currently active [`tes3aiPlanner`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3aiPlanner), meaning the checks will be executed at different intervals for each actor.

## Methods

### `applyDamage`

Damages the actor, with options to control mitigation and difficulty scaling. Invokes the [`damage`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/damage/) and [`damaged`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/damaged/) events, with `tes3.damageSource.script` source. Returns the actual damage done after armor mitigation and resistance, but before difficulty scaling.

```lua
local result = myObject:applyDamage({ damage = ..., applyArmor = ..., resistAttribute = ..., applyDifficulty = ..., playerAttack = ..., doNotChangeHealth = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
