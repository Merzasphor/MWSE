# tes3scriptContext

A script context object, which allows variables to be get/set using the variable name.

## Methods

### `getVariableData`

This method fetches all of the script's variables as a table.

```lua
local results = myObject:getVariableData()
```

**Returns**:

* `results` (table&lt;string, table&gt;): The table with all of script's variable names as keys.

Each entry has following fields:

 1. type  - `s`, `f` or `l`, which stand for `short`, `float`, and `long`
 2. index - the order of occurance of the variable in the script, starting from `0`
 3. value - this can have `nil` value


***

## Math Operations

### Length (`#`)

| Result type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| number | Returns the total amount of variables in this tes3scriptContext. |

??? example "Example: An example of indexing local script variables inside `tes3scriptContext` objects"

	Companions usually have a mwscript script with variable named `companion` set to 1. This can be used to determine if a reference is player's companion or not.

	```lua
	
	--- This function returns `true` if the reference
	--- has a variable companion set to 1 in its script.
	---@param reference tes3reference
	---@return boolean
	local function hasCompanionShare(reference)
	
		-- This shows that we can read any variable inside
		-- `tes3scriptContext` objects as if it was normal Lua table
		-- (`reference.context` is of `tes3scriptContext` type)
	    local companion = reference.context["companion"]
	    return companion and companion == 1
	end

	```
