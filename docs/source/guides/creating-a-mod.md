# Creating a Mod

This guide will demonstrate the most basic steps of creating a mod for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* using MWSE 2.1 Lua.

To facilitate this, this guide will explain how to create a mod that displays a unique messagebox every time the player draws a two-handed weapon.

## Development Workflow
A Development Workflow is the environment and processes used to facilitate software development. This guide assumes that you have setup a development environment. 

If you have not set up a development environment, or do not know how to, please refer to the [Development Workflow](../development-workflows) guide to set one up.

## Introduction to the Lua Scripting Language
If you have basic knowledge of the Lua scripting language, you may skip this section. If you are not familiar with the Lua scripting language, please take a moment to read the [Introduction to Lua](../introduction-to-lua) guide. 

## Introduction to Event Based Programming
If you have basic knowledge of event based programming, you may skip this section. If you are not familiar with event based programming, please take a moment to read the [Introduction to Event Based Programming](../introduction-to-event-based-programming) guide.

## Creating the Mod File Structure
Now that you have setup a development workflow, you are ready to create a mod. 

Next, the folder structure for MWSE must be created:

- In the Morrowind "Data Files" directory, create a folder named "MWSE". This is the folder that contains any MWSE code.
- In "MWSE", create a folder named "mods". This is the folder that contains any MWSE mod code. Other options include "lib" for user-made frameworks and libraries.
- In "mods", create a folder named "MWSE-Guide-Demo". This is the folder that contains the MWSE code for our mod. This folder can include spaces in the folder name. In a normal Morrowind install, you may see other folders here. These represent other mod's code files.

The newly created folder structure should look like this:

- **Morrowind\\Data Files\\MWSE\\mods\\MWSE-Guide-Demo**

Now that the folder structure is complete, you must create a code file to run your code in. 

- In "MWSE-Guide-Demo", create a file named *main.lua*. This file will contain the Lua code for the mod. 

**The main file of your mod must be named main.lua**. This file should configure and initialize any other code files in your mod. The name *main.lua* is required by MWSE.


## Registering an Event
The Morrowind game engine, through MWSE, provides a variety of *events* that can be used to trigger code. An *event* is a trigger that will notify any registered functions of it's occurrence. 

For example, consider the `loaded` event. This event is triggered whenever the player loads a save game. If you register a function to be called when this event occurs, your function will be called when the player loads a save game. By cleverly using Morrowind's events, powerful functionality can be created.

In our file, *main.lua*, we will register an event to trigger our code. It is convention to register your mod's events inside of another event, the `initialized` event. The `initialized` event represents the point when the game and it's mods have been loaded. You can imagine this as the point which the title screen is first shown.

So, first, we will create the `initialized` event.

```lua linenums="1"
-- The function to call on the initialized event.
local function initialized() -- 1.

    -- Print a "Ready!" statement to the MWSE.log file.
    print("[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized") --2.
end

-- Register our initialized function to the initialized event.
event.register("initialized", initialized) --3.
```

1. Declare a function to call whenever the `initialized` event is triggered.
2. It is convention to print a statement stating your mod is initialized at the end of your initialized event function. This is used for debugging.
3. Register our `initialized` function to the `initialized` event.

Now, we want to register an event for what we are actually interested in. In this guide, we are creating a mod that displays a unique messagebox every time the player draws a two-handed weapon. There is an event for that! It is called the `weaponReadied` event.

```lua linenums="1"
-- The function to call on the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied event.
local function showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied(e) -- 1.
    tes3.messageBox("I just drew some weapon.") -- 2.
end

-- The function to call on the initialized event.
local function initialized()
    -- Register our function to the onReadied event.
    event.register("weaponReadied", showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied) --3.

    -- Print a "Ready!" statement to the MWSE.log file.
    print("[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized")
end

-- Register our initialized function to the initialized event.
event.register("initialized", initialized)
```

1. Declare a function to call whenever the `weaponReadied` event is triggered.
2. Add a simple messagebox command.
3. Register our `showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied` function to the `weaponReadied` event.

At this point, the mod can be tested to confirm the events are set up correctly. To do this, follow the workflow described at the beginning of this guide. When you draw your weapon in-game, you should see a messagebox popup!

The details of which events are available and what event data is exposed to them can be found on the [events](../events) page.

## Validating the Event & Showing a Messagebox
Now that the required events have been set up, the `showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied` function should be updated to restrict the types of actions that our code applies to. For the purposes of this guide, the function will only apply to two-handed weapons, and only to the player. The updated function is as follows:

```lua linenums="1"
-- The function to call on the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied event.
local function showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied(e)
    -- Exit the function is the actor is not the player.
    if (e.reference ~= tes3.player) then --1.
        return
    end

    -- Locally store the weapon reference being readied in the event.
    local weaponStack = e.weaponStack --2.

    -- Check that the reference exists and the reference object is a two-handed weapon.
    if (weaponStack and weaponStack.object.isTwoHanded) then --3.
        -- Print our statement.
        tes3.messageBox("I just drew " .. weaponStack.object.name .. ", destroyer of worlds!") --4.
    end
end
```

1. We must check that the event was triggered by the player. Without this step, the code would be executed for all actors, including NPCs and creatures! `e.reference` is an property of the `weaponedReadied` event. `tes3.player` is an easy way to access the player reference.
2. Store a copy of the weaponStack reference in a local variable to prevent typing `e.weaponStack` more than once. 
3. The first part of this if condition checks that the reference exists. This should be done to prevent null reference exceptions. The second part of this if condition performs our validation: it ensures that the weapon being readied is a two-handed weapon.
4. Show a messagebox with some custom object information. `.name` is available on any object.

The mod should be tested again. When drawing a two-handed weapon, you should now see a custom messagebox!

## Conclusion
This guide provided a simple introduction to modding *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* using MWSE 2.1 Lua. 

This guide:

- explained the required folder structure to create a MWSE-Lua mod.
- explained the basics of event registration and callbacks.
- explained how to implement some basic logic in an event callback.

At this point, you can continue reading the MWSE-Lua documentation. Documentation is constantly being improved upon, so ask a question in the [Morrowind Modding Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/QDEBbaP) if you need help.

Here is the final code in *main.lua* for the demo mod:

```lua linenums="1"
-- The function to call on the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied event.
local function showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied(e)
    -- Exit the function is the actor is not the player.
    if (e.reference ~= tes3.player) then
        return
    end

    -- Locally store the weapon reference being readied in the event.
    local weaponStack = e.weaponStack

    -- Check that the reference exists and the reference object is a two-handed weapon.
    if (weaponStack and weaponStack.object.isTwoHanded) then
        -- Print our statement.
        tes3.messageBox("I just drew " .. weaponStack.object.name .. ", destroyer of worlds!")
    end
end

-- The function to call on the initialized event.
local function initialized()
    -- Register our function to the onReadied event.
    event.register("weaponReadied", showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied)

    -- Print a "Ready!" statement to the MWSE.log file.
    print("[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized")
end

-- Register our initialized function to the initialized event.
event.register("initialized", initialized)
```
