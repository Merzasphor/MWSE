## Functions

### `tes3.addArmorSlot`

Registers a new armor slot. Adds a new place for armor pieces with a matching slot number to equip to.

```lua
local wasAdded = tes3.addArmorSlot({ slot = ..., name = ..., weight = ..., scalar = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `slot` (number): Armor slot number. A number greater than 10 to configure a slot for.
	* `name` (string)
	* `weight` (number): *Default*: `0`. A stand-in for the armor base weight value, typically controlled by a GMST (e.g. iHelmWeight).
	* `scalar` (number): *Default*: `0.1`. A multiplier with range 0.0-1.0 that controls how much of an item's armor value applies to a character's overall armor rating. For comparison, standard chest armor uses 0.3, helmets, greaves and pauldrons use 0.1, and gauntlets use 0.05.

**Returns**:

* `wasAdded` (boolean)

***

### `tes3.addClothingSlot`

Registers a new clothing slot. Adds a new place for clothing pieces with a matching slot number to equip to.

```lua
tes3.addClothingSlot({ slot = ..., name = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `slot` (number): Clothing slot number. A number greater than 9 to configure a slot for.
	* `name` (string)

### `tes3.addItem`

Adds an item to a given reference's inventory or mobile's inventory.

```lua
local addedCount = tes3.addItem({ reference = ..., item = ..., itemData = ..., soul = ..., count = ..., playSound = ..., showMessage = ..., limit = ..., reevaluateEquipment = ..., equipProjectiles = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), [tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), string): Who to give items to.
	* `item` ([tes3item](../../types/tes3item), [tes3leveledItem](../../types/tes3leveledItem), string): The item to add. If a leveled item is passed, it will be resolved and added.
	* `itemData` ([tes3itemData](../../types/tes3itemData)): *Optional*. The item data for the item.
	* `soul` ([tes3creature](../../types/tes3creature), [tes3npc](../../types/tes3npc)): *Optional*. For creating filled soul gems.
	* `count` (number): *Default*: `1`. The maximum number of items to add.
	* `playSound` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `false`, the up/down sound for the item won't be played. This only applies if `reference` is the player.
	* `showMessage` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, a message box notifying the player will be shown. This only applies if `reference` is the player.
	* `limit` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `false`, items can be placed into containers that shouldn't normally be allowed. This includes organic containers, and containers that are full.
	* `reevaluateEquipment` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, and the item added is armor, clothing, or a weapon, the actor will reevaluate its equipment choices to see if the new item is worth equipping. This does not affect the player.
	* `equipProjectiles` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, and the reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged. This will only work if the GUI is updated.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `false`, the function won't manually resync the player's GUI state. This can result in some optimizations, though [`tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate()`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uiforceplayerinventoryupdate) must manually be called after all inventory updates are finished.

**Returns**:

* `addedCount` (number)

***

### `tes3.addItemData`

Creates an item data if there is room for a new stack in a given inventory. This can be then used to add custom user data or adjust an item's condition. This will return nil if no item data could be allocated for the item -- for example if the reference doesn't have the item in their inventory or each item of that type already has item data.

```lua
local createdData = tes3.addItemData({ to = ..., item = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `to` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), [tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), string): The reference or mobile whose inventory will be modified.
	* `item` ([tes3item](../../types/tes3item), string): The item to create item data for.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the player or contents menu won't be updated.

**Returns**:

* `createdData` ([tes3itemData](../../types/tes3itemData))

***

### `tes3.addJournalEntry`

This function creates a new journal entry. It can be called once the world controller is loaded.

```lua
tes3.addJournalEntry({ text = ..., showMessage = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `text` (string): The text of the new Journal entry.
	* `showMessage` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If this parameter is true, a "Your journal has been updated" message will be displayed.

***

### `tes3.addMagicEffect`

This function creates a new custom magic effect. The effect can be scripted through lua. This function should be used inside [`magicEffectsResolved`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/magicEffectsResolved/) event callback.

```lua
local effect = tes3.addMagicEffect({ id = ..., name = ..., baseCost = ..., school = ..., size = ..., sizeCap = ..., speed = ..., description = ..., lighting = ..., icon = ..., particleTexture = ..., castSound = ..., boltSound = ..., hitSound = ..., areaSound = ..., castVFX = ..., boltVFX = ..., hitVFX = ..., areaVFX = ..., allowEnchanting = ..., allowSpellmaking = ..., appliesOnce = ..., canCastSelf = ..., canCastTarget = ..., canCastTouch = ..., casterLinked = ..., hasContinuousVFX = ..., hasNoDuration = ..., hasNoMagnitude = ..., illegalDaedra = ..., isHarmful = ..., nonRecastable = ..., targetsAttributes = ..., targetsSkills = ..., unreflectable = ..., usesNegativeLighting = ..., onTick = ..., onCollision = ... })

		- `tickParams` (table)
			- `effectId` (number)
			- `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicSourceInstance/)): Access to the magic source of the effect instance.
			- `deltaTime` (number): The time passed since the last tick of the spell.
			- `effectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicEffectInstance/)): Access to the magic effect instance.
			- `effectIndex` (number): The index of the effect in the spell.

		In addition, a function registered as `onTick` can also call the following methods:

		- trigger(`triggerParams`): Allows the effect to run through the normal spell event system.
			**Parameters:**
			- `triggerParams` (table)
				- `negateOnExpiry` (boolean): *Optional. Default:* `true` If this flag is `true`, the effect will be negated on expiry.
				- `isUncapped` (boolean): *Optional.*
				- `attribute` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectAttribute.nonResistable` The attribute used in resistance calculations agains this effect. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectAttribute`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-attributes/) namespace.
				- `type` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectEventType.boolean`. This flag controls how the effect behaves. For example, `tes3.effectEventType.modStatistic` will make the effect work as calling `tes3.modStatistic`. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectEventType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-event-types/) namespace.
				- `value` (number): *Optional. Default:* `0`. The variable this effect changes.
				- `resistanceCheck(resistParams)` (function): *Optional.* The function passed as `resistanceCheck` will be used on any of the game's spell resistance checks. For example, the only effect in vanilla Morrowind that implements this function is Water Walking. It disallows using a spell with Water Walking when the player is deep underwater, by setting it as expired. So, returning `true` from this function will set your effect to expired, and depending on your trigger code may stop processing. The function passed here must returns boolean values.
					**Parameters**
					- `resistParams` (table)
						- `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicSourceInstance/)): Access to the magic source of the effect instance.
						- `effectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicEffectInstance/)): Access to the magic effect instance.
						- `effectIndex` (number): The index of the effect in the spell.

		- triggerBoundWeapon(`id`): Performs vanilla weapon summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of the weapon with provided ID.
			**Parameters:**
			- `id` (string): The ID of the weapon object to summon.

		- triggerBoundArmor(`params`): Performs vanilla armor summoning logic. It can summon one or two armor objects with provided ID(s).
			**Parameters:**
			- `params` (table)
				- `id` (string): The ID of the armor object to summon.
				- `id2` (string): *Optional.* The ID of the additional armor object to summon.

		- triggerSummon(`id`): Performs vanilla creature summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of a creature with provided ID.
			**Parameters:**
			- `id` (string): The ID of the creature object to summon.

	* `onCollision` (function): *Optional*. A function which will be called when a spell containing this spell effect collides with something.

**Returns**:

* `effect` ([tes3magicEffect](../../types/tes3magicEffect))

	    end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.filterSoulGemTarget, onFilterSoulGemTarget)
	
	-- calcSoulValue event allows assigning a new soul value to creatures
	-- If the event was triggered for an NPC, it allows assigning a value
	-- thus allowing soul-trapping the actor.

local wasAdded = tes3.addSpell({ reference = ..., actor = ..., spell = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), [tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), string): Who to give the spell to. To manipulate an actor without specifying any particular reference, use `actor` instead.

	* `spell` ([tes3spell](../../types/tes3spell), string): The spell to add.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, the GUI will be updated respecting the adding of the spell. This can be useful to disable when batch-adding many spells. The batch should be ended with [`tes3.updateMagicGUI`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updatemagicgui) to reflect the changes.

**Returns**:

* `wasAdded` (boolean): True if the spell was successfully added. This can be false if the actor's race or birthsign already contains the spell.

***

### `tes3.addTopic`

```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `hours` (number): How many hours to progress.

***

### `tes3.calculatePrice`

Calculates a price, given a merchant and associated trading data. This is useful beyond accessing the object's `.value` field in that it raises the appropriate events to let other mods modify the values.

### `tes3.cast`

Casts a spell from a given reference to a target reference. Touch effects will hit the target at any range, while target effects will create a projectile. By default, the spell always casts successfully and does not consume magicka. By default, an actor casting will stop and perform its cast animation, but the 'instant' flag can start the cast instantly and allows more control over the spell for NPCs.

If the caster is the player, the target parameter is optional; without a target, the player's touch effects will only hit targets in front of them, and target effects will create a projectile in the direction the player is facing.

```lua
local success = tes3.cast({ reference = ..., target = ..., spell = ..., instant = ..., alwaysSucceeds = ..., bypassResistances = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), [tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), string): The caster reference.
	* `target` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), [tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), string): The target reference. Optional only if the caster is the player.
	* `spell` ([tes3spell](../../types/tes3spell), string): The spell the caster uses.
	* `instant` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, the spell is cast instantly. No animation is performed.
	* `alwaysSucceeds` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, the spell cannot fail and does not consume magicka. If `false`, it is cast using the actor's spell skill, and requires and takes enough magicka to cast. For NPCs, this only applies if `instant` is `true`.
	* `bypassResistances` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, the spell will bypass the target's resistances. For NPCs, this only applies if `instant` is `true`.

**Returns**:

* `success` (boolean): Returns `true` if the spell was cast successfully. Returns `false` if `instant` is `false` and the player is trying to cast the spell, while being unable to cast spells under normal circumstances.

??? example "Example: This is an example of how to use tes3.cast instead of mwscript.explodeSpell"

	```lua
	-- The following code can be tested in-game by pressing Alt + l or Alt + k
	
	event.register(tes3.event.keyDown, function(e)
		if e.isAltDown then
			tes3.messageBox("mwscript.explodeSpell")
			mwscript.explodeSpell({
				reference = tes3.game.playerTarget,
				spell = "proj_trap_spell"
			})
		end
	end, { filter = tes3.scanCode.l })
	
	event.register(tes3.event.keyDown, function(e)
		if e.isAltDown then
			tes3.messageBox("tes3.cast")
			-- This will behave the same as will mwscript.explodeSpell()
			tes3.cast({
				target = tes3.game.playerTarget,
				reference = tes3.game.playerTarget,
				spell = "proj_trap_spell",
			})
		end
	end, { filter = tes3.scanCode.k })

	```

***

### `tes3.loadAnimation`

Loads an animation and uses it to override existing animations on an actor. Animation groups present in the file will replace the actor's animation groups. The actor's model must be already loaded into memory to have its animations modified. The overridden animations only persist until the actor is unloaded.

Calling this more than once will remove the previous animation override before loading the new animation. Therefore, if applying animations to the player, you should call this before every playAnimation so that different animation mods can co-exist. For NPCs under your mod's control, you only need to do it when the player enters the cell containing the NPC.

Calling this without a file argument will reset the reference's animations to default.

```lua
tes3.loadAnimation({ reference = ..., file = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor), [tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference), string): The reference to the actor that is having its animations modified.
	* `file` (string): *Optional*. The specified animation base file that will be loaded. e.g. For an animation composed of files anim.nif, xanim.nif and xanim.kf, you should pass file="anim.nif". The animation target skeleton _must_ match the skeleton of the actor to work. i.e. 3rd person anims for NPCs and tes3.player, 1st person anims for firstPersonReference.

***

### `tes3.playAnimation`

Plays a given animation group. Optional flags can be used to define how the group starts.

When 'group' is specified, the actor AI is paused while playing the animation, as if in an idle state. When one or more of 'lower', 'upper', or 'shield' are specified without 'group', the actor AI retains control, and the animations are layered. e.g. `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., upper = tes3.animationGroup.idle3, loopCount = 0}` will play the idle3 animation once (without looping) on the upper body, while the player or NPC is still able to walk around. Using 'upper' defers combat actions until the animation is done. Using 'shield' still allows combat actions.

As a special case, `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., group = 0}` returns control to the AI, as the AI knows that is the actor's neutral idle state.

```lua
tes3.playAnimation({ reference = ..., group = ..., lower = ..., upper = ..., shield = ..., startFlag = ..., loopCount = ..., mesh = ... })

### `tes3.rayTest`

Performs a ray test and returns various information related to the result(s). If `findAll` is set, the result will be a table of results, otherwise only the first result is returned.

```lua
local result = tes3.rayTest({ position = ..., direction = ..., findAll = ..., maxDistance = ..., sort = ..., useModelBounds = ..., useModelCoordinates = ..., useBackTriangles = ..., observeAppCullFlag = ..., root = ..., returnColor = ..., returnNormal = ..., returnSmoothNormal = ..., returnTexture = ..., ignore = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `position` ([tes3vector3](../../types/tes3vector3), table): Position of the ray origin.
	* `direction` ([tes3vector3](../../types/tes3vector3), table): Direction of the ray. Does not have to be unit length.

	* `useModelCoordinates` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If true, model coordinates will be used instead of world coordinates.
	* `useBackTriangles` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Include intersections with back-facing triangles.
	* `observeAppCullFlag` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. Ignore intersections with culled (hidden) models.
	* `root` ([niNode](../../types/niNode)): *Default*: `tes3.game.worldRoot`. Node pointer to node scene. To reduce the computational work, consider passing only a smaller subset of the `worldRoot` to improve performance. The typical nodes you can pass here are: [`tes3.game.worldLandscapeRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldLandscapeRoot), [`worldObjectRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldObjectRoot), and [`worldPickRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldPickRoot).

??? example "Example: Get Activation Target"

	This example performs a ray test to match the normal activation target test. Unlike `tes3.getPlayerTarget()` this will return objects not normally available for activation.

	```lua
	local hitResult = tes3.rayTest({ position = tes3.getPlayerEyePosition(), direction = tes3.getPlayerEyeVector() })
	local hitReference = hitResult and hitResult.reference
	if (hitReference == nil) then
		return
	end
	
	tes3.messageBox("The player is looking at a '%s'", hitReference.object.name or hitReference.object.id)

	```

??? example "Example: Get Camera Target"

	This example performs a ray test to see what the camera is currently looking at.

	```lua
	local hitResult = tes3.rayTest({ position = tes3.getCameraPosition(), direction = tes3.getCameraVector() })
	local hitReference = hitResult and hitResult.reference
	if (hitReference == nil) then
		return
	end
	
	tes3.messageBox("The camera is looking at a '%s'", hitReference.object.name or hitReference.object.id)

	```

??? example "Example: Multiple Results"

	This example performs a ray test and displays all results in the entire ray test, rather than ending at the first object hit.

	```lua
	local results = tes3.rayTest{ tes3.getCameraPosition(), direction = tes3.getCameraVector(), findAll = true }
	if results then
		for i, hit in pairs(results) do
			mwse.log("Ray hit #%d: %s", i, hit.reference or "<non-reference>");
		end
	end

	```

??? example "Example: Save rayTest result for use at a later point"

	If you plan to use the results of rayTest, you should make sure it still exists. For example, an object which was in a list of results of rayTest can get unloaded when the player changes cells and become invalid, so it shouldn't be accessed.

	```lua
	local result = tes3.rayTest{ -- the result can get invalidated
		position = tes3.getPlayerEyePosition(),
		direction = tes3.getPlayerEyeVector(),
		ignore = { tes3.player }
	}
	
	local refHandle
	
	if result then
		refHandle = tes3.makeSafeObjectHandle(result.reference)
	end
	
	local function myFunction()
		-- Before using the reference, we need to check that it's still valid.
		-- References get unloaded on cell changes etc.
		if refHandle:valid() then
			-- Now we can safely do something with our stored reference.
			local reference = refHandle:getObject()
	
		end
	end

	```

??? example "Example: Simulating a Dispel"

	In this example there is a 50 % chance that any Water Breathing magic effects will be removed from the player when he/she is underwater.

	```lua
	local function example(e)
			-- We only care about the player
		if (e.mobile.objectType ~= tes3.objectType.mobilePlayer) then
			return
		end
	
		local cell = tes3.mobilePlayer.cell
