# Event Definitions Guide

Event definitions are formatted as regular Lua tables. The available fields are:
| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| type  | `string` |  This flag is used when generating syntax highlighting files. This should always be `"event"` for event definitions. |
| description | `string` | The description for the event. |
| eventData | `table` | A table describing the data made available by the event. |
| filter | `string` | This allow specifying by which of the eventData parameters the event can be filtered. The name of the parameter should be enclosed in `""`. |
| blockable | `boolean` | Only needs to be present when the event indeed is blockable. In that case `true` should be passed here. |
| examples | `table` | A table with entries that are the names of the files included as examples. Each entry is a table itself with one available field, `title`. The title will be shown as the title of the example on the documentation page. |


eventData table entries can have the following fields:
| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| type  | `string` | This allows to specify the type of the value in `evenData`. You can put string names for basic Lua types: `number`, `boolean` and `string`, or objects exposed by MWSE, such as `tes3reference`. If the value can be of two or more types, then you should pass all the types split by `|`. For example, `tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|nil`. |
| readOnly | `boolean` | This will mark the value as read-only. |
| description | `string` | The description for the value. You can pass a string with `""` or `[[]]`. |


`examples` table looks like this:
| Field |   Type  | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| entry | `table` | Each entry in examples table should be the file name of the file used as an example. The example file should just be regular Lua code. All the example files need to be inside the folder of the same name as the event these examples are for. |


An example of a event definition is the `activate` event definition file found in autocomplete\definitions\events\standard:

```Lua
-- autocomplete\definitions\events\standard\activate.lua
return {
	type = "event",
	description = [[This event is invoked whenever something is activated, typically by the player. Activation is usually done with the associated activate/use key, but may also be forced by scripts.

Non-player actors may also activate objects, such as when opening doors, or via MWSE functions like [`tes3.activate()`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3activate).

Some examples of when the activate event fires includes:

- When a door is used.
- When an item is picked up.
- When someone attempts to open a container.]],
	eventData = {
		["activator"] = {
			type = "tes3reference",
			readOnly = true,
			description = "The actor attempting to trigger the event.",
		},
		["target"] = {
			type = "tes3reference",
			readOnly = true,
			description = "The reference that is being activated.",
		},
	},
	filter = "target",
	blockable = true,
	examples = {
		-- autocomplete\definitions\events\standard\activate\ShowActivationTarget.lua
		["ShowActivationTarget"] = {
			title = "Show a message for what the player is activating",
		},
		-- autocomplete\definitions\events\standard\activate\PreventActivatingNPCs.lua
		["PreventActivatingNPCs"] = {
			title = "Prevent the player from activating NPCs",
		},
	},

}
```
