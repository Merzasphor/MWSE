how to build this:

1. Install inno setup (from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
2. Build MWSE DLL and MWSE_Launcher in release mode
3. Edit Setup2.iss and change 0.9.4 to appropriate value
4. Compile, and you should get a Setup.exe (MWSE.dll and MWSE Launcher.exe
   are picked up from the builds in step 2).
