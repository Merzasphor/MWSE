Unaltered third-party stuff goes here.

Presently:
 boost 1_34_0; download from boost.org. Extract to here; should appear as
 boost_1_34_0; (If version is updated, boost_regex project needs to be
 updated, and include paths in MWSE DLL project.)
 (7/7/07 AnthonyG: Source files referenced in the boost-regex proj file have been moved to
  the boost-regex directory. This should help avoid the problems I've been having)

 WTL8; download from sourceforge.net/projects/wtl, and extract INSIDE
 the WTL8 directory. Currently, we are using WTL 8.0.6356 (December 22, 2006).
 (7/7/07 AnthonyG: To be removed, will implement reusable code that 
  can easily rebuild the interface)
