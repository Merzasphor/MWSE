Hello everyone, I'd rather not make enemies on my first night by making any changes.

I must say however, Some of this code needs to be rewritten, Badly.

Structs should not replace classes

Logic shoudn't be placed in a member function. (I.E. main())

I will begin work on a class to eliminate the need to have MWSE placed in the Morrowind Install directory.

Release shouldn't generate debug information.

A few other things but my coffee has ran out and I need sleep :).
