		The Morrowind Script Extender is a program designed to increase the features
		available to Morrowind scripters.   When run with the game, it adds extra
		script functions, allowing the creation of plugins that are impossible or
		at least very difficult while running the game alone.
		</p>
		<p>
		This version builds upon the 0.9.2 version from cdcooley,
		it only supports Morrowind version 1.6.1820 (Bloodmoon and GOTY versions).
		</p>
		<p>
		for any support go to: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse</a>, or PM Tp21 or Fliggerty on the forums.
		</p>

		<h3>Installing and Running the Program</h3>

		Simply put the <b>MWSE.exe</b> program into your Morrowind installation directory 
		and run it to start the game.  It will start the <b>Morrowind Launcher</b> and 
		then wait for the game to start.  It also automatically shuts itself down when
		Morrowind ends.  (You don't have to start the game from the launcher.  If you quit 
		the launcher without starting Morrowind, MWSE will keep running until you stop it 
		or start the game some other way.)
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
		<h3>Using Other Programs (MWE, FPS Optimizer, MGE) with MWSE</h3>

		you can bypass the launcher by putting "Morrowind.exe" as an argument to the shortcut (after MWSE.exe).
		it then starts Morrowind.exe automaticly.
		you can redirect other programs to start MWSE instead of Morrowind.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>Source and Support files for Modders and Scripters</h3>

		any new version can be found at: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse</a>, you can find all the packagedetails there.
