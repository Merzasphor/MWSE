		The Morrowind Script Extender is a program designed to increase the features
		available to Morrowind scripters.   When run with the game, it adds extra
		script functions, allowing the creation of plugins that are impossible or
		at least very difficult while running the game alone.
		</p>
		<p>
		This version builds upon the 0.9.2 version from cdcooley,
		it only supports Morrowind version 1.6.1820 (Bloodmoon and GOTY versions).
