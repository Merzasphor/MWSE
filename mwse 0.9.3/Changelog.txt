New launcher (formerly known as the loader). Written using WTL 8, it has
the following features:
 - Buttons to launch Morrowind's launcher, view MWSE log, and exit
 - Launcher does not need to be in Morrowind directory (but MWSE.dll
   needs to be in _launcher's_ directory)
 - Does not hang or use lots of CPU when looking for Morrowind to start
 - Log is once again a text file (MWSELog.txt in Morrowind directory)
 - Detects Morrowind (and injects MWSE.dll) when Morrowind is launched
   externally
 - Buttons (launch, view log) disable/enable as appropriate
