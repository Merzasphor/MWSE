Presently:
 boost 1.33.1; download from boost.org. Extract to here; should appear as
 boost_1_33_1. (If version is updated, boost_regex project needs to be

 WTL8; download from sourceforge.net/projects/wtl, and extract INSIDE
 the WTL8 directory. Currently, we are using WTL 8.0.6356 (December 22, 2006).
