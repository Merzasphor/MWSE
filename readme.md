### Download the latest nightly build [here](https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/releases/download/build-automatic/mwse.zip)!

The previous stable release is available at the [Morrowind Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45468), but is now bundled by default with [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102).  
The stable release does **not** include Lua support.
