It groups all values returned by pattern p into a single capture. The group may be anonymous (if no
name is given) or named with the given name (which can be any non-nil Lua value).

An anonymous group serves to join values from several captures into a single capture. A named
group has a different behavior. In most situations, a named group returns no values at all. Its
values are only relevant for a following back capture or when used inside a table capture.]],
