	description = [[Plays a given animation group. Optional flags can be used to define how the group starts.

When 'group' is specified, the actor AI is paused while playing the animation, as if in an idle state. When one or more of 'lower', 'upper', or 'shield' are specified without 'group', the actor AI retains control, and the animations are layered. e.g. `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., upper = tes3.animationGroup.idle3, loopCount = 0}` will play the idle3 animation once (without looping) on the upper body, while the player or NPC is still able to walk around. Using 'upper' defers combat actions until the animation is done. Using 'shield' still allows combat actions.

As a special case, `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., group = 0}` returns control to the AI, as the AI knows that is the actor's neutral idle state.]],
