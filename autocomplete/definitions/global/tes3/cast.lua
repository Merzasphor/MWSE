By default, an actor casting will stop and perform its cast animation, but the 'instant' flag can start the cast instantly, and allow more control over the spell.

When the caster is the player, the target parameter is optional; without a target, the player's touch effects will only hit targets in front of them, and target effects will create a projectile in the direction the player is facing. Currently as a limitation, instant must be true to allow the player to cast spells.]],
