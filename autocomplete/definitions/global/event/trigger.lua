After an event has been claimed by a certain function (by setting the `claim` in eventData to `true`) no other registered callback functions will be executed on this event trigger. This is useful if you wish to implement blocking system for your event. In addition, this can be used to the same effect as some MWSE's events allow changing some of the `eventData` values to modify the behavior of the vanilla mechanics." }
