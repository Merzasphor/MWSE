For negative values, there is a special case behaviour: all children but the last will be left-aligned/top-aligned, the last child will be right-aligned/bottom-aligned.
	
	Child alignment only works if the element has proportional sizing (using widthProportional/heightProportional) and all children use non-proportional sizing (widthProportional and heightProportional are nil).]],
