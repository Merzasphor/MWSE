Useful for element class-specific properties. Returns `nil` if the property key did not have data, or if it could not guess the type of the property value.
    
    For `getPropertyObject`, an expected return value not derived from `tes3baseObject` requires the usertype to be provided as well. Currently accepted usertypes are:
	`tes3itemData`
	`tes3itemStack`
	`tes3gameFile`
	`tes3inventoryTile`
	`tes3uiElement`
	
	This is required because there is no identifying type information stored with the pointer. If the usertype is incorrect, there are no safety checks keeping the game from crashing.]],
