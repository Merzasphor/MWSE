The Morrowind Script Extender is a program designed to increase the features available to Morrowind scripters. When run with the game, it adds extra script functions, allowing the creation of plugins that are impossible or at least very difficult while running the game alone.

This version builds upon the 0.9.2 version from cdcooley, it only supports Morrowind version 1.6.1820 (Bloodmoon and GOTY versions).

For any support go to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse, or PM Tp21, games1216(AnthonyG), or Fliggerty on the TES Forums.

The Morrowind Script Extender is free software, licensed according to the GNU Public License, and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. See the file gpl.txt for details if you are interested in distributing or modifying the program.
