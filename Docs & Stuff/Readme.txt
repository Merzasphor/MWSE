The Morrowind Script Extender is a program designed to increase the features available to Morrowind scripters. When run with the game, it adds extra script functions, allowing the creation of plugins that are impossible or at least very difficult while running the game alone.

This version builds upon the 0.9.2 version from cdcooley, it only supports Morrowind version 1.6.1820 (Bloodmoon and GOTY versions).

For any support go to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwse, or PM Tp21, games1216(AnthonyG), or Fliggerty on the TES Forums.

The Morrowind Script Extender is free software, licensed according to the GNU Public License, and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. See the file gpl.txt for details if you are interested in distributing or modifying the program.

Installing and Running the Program

If you have downloaded the installer, it will install by default to C:\Program Files\MWSE.  You will be given the option to install elsewhere though.  

If you have downloaded the ZIP file, place MWSE Launcher.exe and MWSE.dll in a location of your choice.

It will work regardless of which directory it is installed into.

For multiple Morrowind installations, the MWSE Launcher will find the location of the last installed version.  It checks the registry key HKLM\Software\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind,Installed Path and launches the Morrowind Launcher.exe found there.  However, it will also check for Morrowind.exe in the same directory.  So to avoid renaming your installation folders, you can simply put multiple copies of MWSE into each installation directory.


************************************

MWSE Launcher: There is now a GUI style launcher.  It has three buttons: Launch Morrowind, View Log, and Exit.  Launch Morrowind will start Morrowind Launcher.exe; note that the MWSE Launcher does not have to be restarted to launch Morrowind again.  View Log will open MWSElog.txt.  And Exit will close the MWSE Launcher.
