# Morrowind Script Extender

## Synopsis
The Morrowind Script Extender makes additional functions available for use in
Morrowind scripts, beyond those provided by the game's construction set. 

These extra functions allow modders to add features and behavior to scripts that
would otherwise be impractical or impossible.

## Installation

* Download the latest MWSE release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Merzasphor/MWSE/releases) and unpack to a temporary directory.
* If you use MGE XE 0.10.0 beta 9 or later:
	* (Optional) Backup `MWSE.dll` in your Morrowind directory.
	* Copy `MWSE.dll` from the archive in step 1 to your Morrowind directory.
	* You can now start Morrowind as before. MGE XE will load the updated `MWSE.dll` on startup.
* If you do not use MGE XE:
	* (Optional) If they exist, backup the following files in your Morrowind directory: `MWSE.dll`, `MWSE Launcher.exe`.
	* Copy `MWSE.dll` and `MWSE Launcher.exe` from the archive in step 1 to your Morrowind directory.
	* To run Morrowind with MWSE enabled, run `MWSE Launcher.exe` and click "Launch Morrowind".
* (Optional) MWEdit
	* (Optional) Backup `customfunctions.dat` in your MWEdit directory.
	* Copy `customfunctions.dat` from the archive in step 1 to your MWEdit directory.
	* MWEdit will now be able to compile scripts that contain MWSE functions.

The [Morrowind Code Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510/) is highly recommended.
